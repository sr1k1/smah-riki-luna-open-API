                <p class = 'intro-start-line'>The official Marvel website gives the following as a description for the Ultimate Spider-Man series:</p>

                <p>The Ultimate Spider-Man comics have experienced a decade of rich story-telling before the comic's protagonist, Peter Parker, passes away 
                    in a final attempt to keep his family safe.</p>

                <p>This version of the Ultimate universe gets destroyed in an interdimensional conflict that spans the entire multiverse, but the Reed Richards
                    of that universe (who calls himself "The Maker") survives. This leads him to escape into a different universe that he intends to reshape to his image 
                    by removing the canon events that shaped the heroes in the original continuity. Most notably (for us, anyways), he kills the spider that is ultimately
                    destined to give Peter Parker his powers, and as a result, he never becomes Spider-Man.
                </p>
                <p>The new Ultimate universe is a take on what the lives of our favorite superheroes would look like if they got their powers much later in life. Peter Parker's 
                    Uncle Ben is now alive well into his 20s; does this make him a different Spider-Man? He has a family of his own complete with a wife and two kids; how do they
                    affect Peter as the selfless superhero he is known to be in the original continuity?
                </p>
