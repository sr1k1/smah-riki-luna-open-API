Open API Final Project for CTD's Luna Course! For this project, I have used the Marvel API to retrieve information on two current comic series: Ultimate Spider-Man and Ultimate Black Panther!

The website is not a live website! To use it, download the GitHub repo and open the index.html file. Once it has loaded, click the "Spider-Man" button to fetch information related to the Ultimate Spider-Man series, and the "Black Panther" button for the other. A thumbnail of each comic, along with a description of the series, is displayed for your reading pleasure!
